Version 1.6.1: 2016-12-21
  - New: One-dimensional topology through the class `Lattice1D`.
  - New: The coordinate transformation and scaling is exposed via the function `center_coordinates`.
  - Changed: The two dimensional topology is now defined through the class `Lattice2D`.

  - Fixed: Different resolution and physical size across different axes is possible.
  - Fixed: Nonzero angular momentum no longer produces nan in the state if the offset is negative.

Version 1.5.5: 2016-06-13
  - Fixed: Particle density is scaled correctly.

Version 1.5.4: 2016-05-10
  - Fixed: `vortex_position` works correctly with Python 3.

Version 1.5.3: 2016-04-22
 - New: `vortex_position` function detects when a vortex is not present.

Version 1.5.2: 2016-03-02
 - New: Static library target to make distributed examples run easier on clusters.
 - Fixed: Windows version compiles again.
 - Fixed: Renormalization in the imaginary time evolution is fixed and simplified.
 - Fixed: Installing the C++ library works again.
 - Fixed: Python CUDA version works.

Version 1.5.1: 2016-02-15
 - New: Updating parameters is possible even after the solver was instantiated. Call the method `update_parameters` of the solver class.
 - New: Helper functions added to track vortices.
 - Changed: Since the lattice resolution is the same in either direction, now only one parameter handles it in the corresponding class.
 - Fixed: The second potential in a two-component Hamiltonian is correctly handled.

Version 1.5: 2016-01-31
 - New: Improved API that allows the user to define and solve problems in physical terms. Classes were introduced for the lattice, the state, the potential, the Hamiltonian, and for the solver.
 - New: Time-dependent potentials are possible.
 - New: CUDA support in the Python interface.
 - Changed: SSE kernel was removed.
 - Changed: MATLAB interface was removed.
 - Changed: More robust compilation of CUDA version in the Python wrapper.
 - Fixed: Code compiles again with the hybrid kernel.

Version 1.4: 2015-10-25
 - New: CPU kernel implements the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
 - New: performing imaginary time evolution, all kernels output a wave function normalized with a set value provided as input.
 - New: The command-line interface, and the Python and MATLAB wrappers only need Hamiltonian parameters, lattice parameters and evolution parameters as input.
 - New: Sphinx documentation for the Python wrapper, including examples.
 - Changed: Example of MATLAB wrapper.
 - Fixed: Python 3 compatibility.
 - Fixed: MAC OS X can compile, but it does not support SSE kernel.

Version 1.3: 2015-07-04
 - New: Wrappers for Python and MATLAB.
 - New: Compiles on Windows with Visual Studio.
 - Changed: Code compiles without MPI.
 - Fixed: No single process has to hold the entire state or potential in memory.

Version 1.2: 2015-06-08

 - New: Imaginary time evolution to find ground state.
 - New: Periodic boundary conditions are possible.
 - New: Arbitrary stationary potential function can be defined.
 - New: CLI for specifying the files of the initial state and the potential,
        and the parameters of the Hamiltonian.
 - New: API added through the `trotter` function.
 - New: Convenience function to get expectation values (`expect_values`).
 - New: Unit testing framework.
 - Changed: Single-precision calculations were removed entirely.
 - Changed: Examples split into separate folder.
